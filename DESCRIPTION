Description: Angle Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) is a
    dimensionality reduction algorithm for multiple data blocks (multiple data
    matrices with the same set of observations, but distinct variables).
    AJIVE  finds joint modes of variation that are common to all data blocks as
    well as individual modes of variation that are specific to each block.
    TODO: add more.
